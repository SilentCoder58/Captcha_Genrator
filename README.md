# Captcha_Genrator with Tkinter

This is a simple Python project that generates a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) using Tkinter for the GUI and the `captcha` library to create and display the CAPTCHA image. The application verifies the user's input against a randomly generated 6-digit code.

## Features
- Random 6-digit CAPTCHA generation
- GUI with Tkinter for user interaction
- Option to refresh the CAPTCHA image
- Verifies user input against the displayed CAPTCHA code
- Works on Linux systems with proper font paths for the CAPTCHA image

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- `captcha` library for generating CAPTCHA images

You can install the required Python package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install captcha
```

Additionally, ensure that Tkinter is installed on your system. On Linux, you can install Tkinter using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Font Files
The project requires two specific font files to generate the CAPTCHA image. You can place them in a folder named `fonts` within the project directory:

- `ChelseaMarketsr.ttf`
- `DejaVuSanssr.ttf`

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip` and ensure Tkinter is set up.
3. Make sure the `fonts` folder is in the project directory and contains the required font files (`ChelseaMarketsr.ttf` and `DejaVuSanssr.ttf`).
4. If you're running the project on a different operating system, update the `FONT_PATHS` in the script to point to the correct font paths.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Captcha_Generator.py
   ```
2. A window will pop up with the CAPTCHA image displayed.
3. Enter the 6-digit code displayed in the image into the text box.
4. Click the "Submit" button to verify the code.
   - If the code matches, a success message will appear.
   - If the code is incorrect, a warning will appear, and the CAPTCHA will refresh.

5. You can click the "Refresh" button to generate a new CAPTCHA.
